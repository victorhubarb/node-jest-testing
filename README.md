## Project Description
This project focuses on implementing various testing strategies for a REST API that manages a bookstore system. The API includes functionality for managing books, authors, and publishers. This project leverages testing frameworks and tools such as Jest and SuperTest to ensure the reliability and maintainability of the API, using static analysis, unit testing, and integration testing.

## Features
- **Static Testing**:
  - ESLint is used for static code analysis to ensure code follows best practices and proper formatting without executing the code.
  
- **Unit Testing**:
  - Jest is employed to create unit tests, focusing on the behavior of small, isolated parts of the bookstore API.
  - Native assertion methods are used for comparing values and testing expected outputs.

- **Integration Testing**:
  - Integration tests are run using SuperTest, simulating HTTP requests to ensure the proper interaction between different parts of the API.

- **Test Coverage**:
  - Jestâ€™s `--coverage` flag is used to generate test coverage reports, helping identify untested portions of the API.
